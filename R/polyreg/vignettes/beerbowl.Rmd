Let's reexamine the age old topic of [beer and bowling](http://bowlmovementswy.blogspot.com/2009/06/on-beer-and-bowling.html).
A commonly held belief is that beer offers only a minimal, then diminishing 
 impact to a players score as drinking continues. A supporting observation of this 
 would be a plot indicating an increase then decrease in bowling average.
 To achieve this, we'll use the polyreg package and it's included data source, beerbowl.

In our case; 

 * *y* is the average game handicapped score by bowler
 * *x* is the average number of beers consumed during event over 30 frames

```{r,, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 6, fig.align = "center"}
library(polyreg)
plot_r(beerbowl)
```
